# 2XA3 Final Project

This is my final project for the course 2XA3. The course teaches about BASH scripting, makefiles, and x86 assembly. The final project was written in x86 NASM assembly.

For the final project, we were to take as an input a digit from 2 to 9. Using an external function, we would set up an array of numbers between 1 and the input digit. We would output the initial configuration, representing the numbers as disks of arying radius on a peg.

Next, we were to sort the disks, and output the configuration at each step. We were to use recursion to sort them, and use a variation of insertion sort that was described to us in high level pseudo code.

At the end we output the final configuration of the disks.

The only code we were resposible for writing is in `sorthem.asm`. The other files were provided.

### Running this code

I wrote and ran this code on a server that had NASM set up properly in order to run x86 assembly. As of now, I haven't been able to figure out how to get it to work on my computer, but will continue to work on figuring it out.
